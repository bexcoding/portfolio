# Project Overview

The purpose of this 'cipher project' is to implement several different common ciphers that can encrypt or decrypt a given text. None of these ciphers is new. They all have been written many times before by many others. Instead, I am setting out to write these ciphers in order to get practice with writing Python. Where possible, I will try to add my own flair. I hope to end up with several different ciphers that I can combine into either a module or package to get practice with making different files work together. I also hope to allow two different methods of interaction:
    1. inserting text manually by typing or copying and pasting into the terminal and recieving the results in the terminal.
    2. providing the name of the file that I want encrypted/decrypted and getting the output sent to another file.
I may also include the code necessary to break these codes. As a disclaimer, I am writing this project in the same order as the book that I am following to write this code - "Cracking Codes with Python" by Al Sweigart. He teaches Python in this book by showing his way of implementing certain ciphers. While I will consult his solutions, I will ultimately be writing my own and not simply copying his. I appreciate his desire to help others learn Python by providing many of his books for free online at inventwithpython.com. 

# Ciphers Included

| Cipher Name    | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Reverse Cipher | Does not change any element of the message. Simply reverses the elements in the message. For this reason, the same function can perform both encryption and decryption. |
