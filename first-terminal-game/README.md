# My First Python Terminal Game
---

This is a game written for the command line using python. The original game was written as my first undirected project.

### Premise and Background
---

I wrote this game at my lowest point in my nursing career while taking care of COVID patients in the ICU. The plot is that you have to make it through a day as a nurse while not getting in trouble with your boss or getting attacked by a drunk man. The scenarios played out the way that I felt at the time - that there was no way to make everyone happy or to predict what crazy things would happen in a single day. While things are much better for me now as I revise the code, it is funny to look back on the wacky scenarios that I invented for the game.

This is one of my first programs that I wrote after I learned python. It is written in the style of the earliest computer games: text-based adventure. While there are cooler video games that can be created with graphics, text-based games allow coding beginners to circumnavigate the difficult code that is involved in modern video games and focus on logic - i.e., if you do this thing, some other thing will happen.

I originally wrote the code for this game in May of 2022. This original code will be labeled as 'original-game.py' and will remain unchanged from its original form. However, even weeks after writing the program, I learned of better ways of performing some of the tasks within the code. The most obvious example that catches my eye as I look at the original is that I didn't know about 'newline' characters yet. Every time I wanted a new line, I would add a 'print(" ")' statement which could be easily cleaned up by adding '\n' in the given string.

The newer version written in February of 2023 will be just one of the ways that I figured that the code could be re-written. This new version will be labeled as 'updated-game.py'. Feel free to look at both versions to see how this game changed over time.
