# My Portfolio

My name is Alexander Beck and I have created this repository as a way to showcase the style of code that I am capable of producing. While I began learning python and the essentials of software development in early 2022, it did not occur to me until almost a year into my studies that it would be important to catalogue my progress. At that time, I had no idea that I would continue learning about computers and their software. It was one idea of many possible career changes. After a year of practice, I can safely say that I have come a long way. I can also tell that I have much more to learn still. From now on, I will try my best to be consistent in adding to my collection of coding examples in this 'portfolio' folder. My goal is to gather sufficient evidence to show to future employerst that, while I am a professional nurse, I am also a capable of being a professional software developer.
