# Coding Problems 

This section is a series of coding problems that attempts to use logic and computation to solve a real world problem. Each problem was designed and then solved by me. Each problem includes a markdown file that gives prompt for solving the problem as well as information about why I solved the problem in a particular way. There also may be additional files that test the functions in the solution file. 


| Problem | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| Staffing Problem | Create a solution that checks that there will be enough nurses to take care of the patients in the ICU on the nex shift. |
